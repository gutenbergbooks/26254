The thought gave
her the same thrill this
morning as it had given her
on a morning seventeen
years back, when the old
family doctor had laid a tiny
bundle in her arms and said,
"You'll have to be his sister
and mother both, Elizabeth."</p>

<p>Her twelve years then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hung heavily on her; her
little face, stained with the
marks of recent tears, took
on a warmer glow as she
touched the baby's hand.
She had unfolded the baby
blanket and slipped on his
first little clothes. And as
she dressed him, she felt a
sense of loss; with every
fresh garment he seemed to
become less of an angel and
more of a human being.
The same feeling of loss
was now in her heart as
she folded his great Indian
blankets, slipped his photographs
into the case and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
filled the nooks and crevices
of his trunk with "little
surprises" to drive away
the first bitter longings for
home. She lifted a thick
white wool sweater; it
brought the memory of a
little soft flannel shirt. She
buried her face in its folds
and murmured in a tearful
voice, "Why, he is my man
brother and I am sending
him from home to college."</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>His foot sounded on the
stairway; his clear boyish
voice called, "Beth, where
are you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Before she could answer
he entered the room.
Throwing several bundles
onto the bed, he gave a
sigh of relief. He tugged
impatiently at the strings
as he explained: "These
are some things the girls
made me. It's great to be
going away, isn't it? Why,
I feel just like I was getting
out of a cage; I feel
like I was going to fly.
Say, what is this, anyway?"</p>

<p>He held up a small book,
shaped to resemble the bud
of a flower. It was made
of white water-colour paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and every leaf was fastened
to the other leaves by small
white cords. On the front
was the picture of a baby;
on the back was a pair of
black kid doll shoes.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?"
his sister asked.</p>

<p>"Rose gave it to me;
she told me a long time ago
that she was making me a
book of memories; that I
was to open just one page
a week. That's my baby
picture, all right, but why
on earth has she put those
doll slippers on the back?
And why is it shaped in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
this funny way? What
makes girls such queer creatures,
anyway, Beth?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "I guess,
Floyd, if this is a book of
memories, that last page is
to picture the last great
event of your life&mdash;your
graduation night. Don't
you remember how your
new patent leathers pinched
your feet, so that you limped
across the platform after
your diploma? It is shaped
like a rosebud, for it is like
that. Every week you will
open a new petal, and
finally, when you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
opened them all, it will be a
full-blown rose. When you
come back Rose will have
unfolded a few petals, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to unfold
every one of these right
now. I never could wait
that long to see what is in
the centre. Of course I
have a vague idea, but I
want to be sure. So in two
minutes we will know this
mystery."</p>

<p>"No," she said firmly,
taking the book from his
hand. "What would the
book mean to you then,
Floyd? Every particle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the pleasure&mdash;the expectation&mdash;would
be gone. It
took Rose a long time to
make this book and you
surely would not destroy its
value in a few minutes. She
even formed every leaf like
a petal, so that it would
give you the pleasure of
watching it unfold like a
real rose. It is just a symbol
of herself&mdash;a little bud
of promise."</p>

<p>"She's great to think of
all that; I like her. Oh,
she and Dorothy are going
to stop a minute to-night;
Dot has something for me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and I want them to see
some of my things. But I
do want to open this book.
I guess I will give it to you
to keep until I am ready to
shut this trunk, so it won't
be such a temptation. But
let's eat pretty soon; I am
simply starved."</p>

<p>At the supper table he
talked incessantly of his departure.
One moment he
wished that she could go
along; the next he exulted
over the idea of being in a
house with a crowd of fellows.
While he talked a
boy came to the door and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was dragged in by a ruthless
hand. While they ate
quantities of hot waffles they
talked of the "fellows and
girls." For the most part
they talked of the girls. The
sister heard new phrases&mdash;a
new language; he had always
used a different one to
her. They spoke of girls as
"four-flushers," as "easies,"
as "stiffs" and "stand-patters."
Occasionally Floyd
stopped in the centre of a
remark and nodded his
head warningly towards his
sister, but the talkative John
rambled on, speaking in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
free and easy way of the
girls he had grown up
with.</p>

<p>During the last year
Floyd had ceased to talk
to his sister about his girl
friends, and they seldom
came to his home. In
her presence his comrades
talked continually of school;
but if she was busy near she
could hear them laughing
and chatting in tones different
from the ones they used
when she was there. She
had tried in every way she
could to attract them to her
home, for formerly they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
come in great crowds. But
Floyd did not seem to want
them; he preferred going
to their homes. At times
she wondered if she had
been in their way when they
had come.</p>

<p>When the two girls came
she greeted them warmly;
they had belonged to the
crowd which had come in
the past often for cookies
and for help in long, knotty
problems. Then, thinking
they might not remain if
she was present, she went
into the next room.
Through the open door she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
watched them. She could
not help watching; she had
been deprived of all her
girlhood and now she
wanted to enjoy theirs.</p>

<p>Dorothy, a dimpled,
laughing girl with great,
brown eyes and masses of
curls which were always
rumpled, threw her hat into
a chair and was soon seated
between the two boys, showing
them the posters she
had made for Floyd. The
sister saw Floyd move very
close to the girl and lay his
hand on her shoulder with
a caressing movement; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
caught the glance that he
gave&mdash;a glance full of bold
admiration and meaning.
Rose stood near the table,
watching the other girl. In
her eyes was a look of longing,
and yet it was mingled
with fear. The three on the
sofa soon drew her into their
circle, John was open in
his admiration of both girls;
he tried to distribute his
caresses with an impartial
hand, but the little Rose
drew away with that expression
of dread in her
eyes. Floyd was not so
bold; he lightly laid his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
hand on her hand, and
when she did not resent it
clasped it more firmly. Her
face flushed, but she suffered
the hand to remain.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was called from
the room by some visitors.
When they had finally gone
she came back to her former
seat. She saw a new brother,
a different one from the one
she knew. He was talking
in a boisterous tone.</p>

<p>"When are you going to
kiss me good-bye, Dot?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Right at the station,"
she answered laughingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Honour bright?" He
asked.</p>

<p>"Honour bright," she
promised.</p>

<p>"You are all right," he
exclaimed. "Rose is too
bashful for that." Then he
hinted, "But you see I am
going to take her home to-night."</p>

<p>Rose coloured as he
gave her a significant
look. She pushed his hand
from her arm and walked
to the piano. But there
was a wavering, an uncertainty
in her face. He
had been her comrade so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
long and she really liked
him.</p>

<p>The watching sister made
a quick decision. When
the girls rose to go, she
stood up saying, "Floyd, I
want you and John to watch
the house. I have to see
Rose's mother to-night;
to-morrow you can see the
girls again."</p>

<p>There came a flush of
annoyance on the boyish
face, followed by one of
anger. He knew his sister
had been listening. But he
was still too loyal to criticize
her to John, who, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
they were alone, openly denounced
her for her meddling.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>When she returned Floyd
was alone. He sat sulky
and silent. She busied herself
with the household
cares for a few minutes.
Soon she went over to the
lounge and sat down beside
him. She put her arm
around him and kissed his
forehead. "Let's don't be
angry on our last night,"
she begged.</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?"
he asked. "I know you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
heard what I said to Rose,
but what is she to you?"</p>

<p>"A great deal," she responded,
"but not so much
as the boy I love so dearly&mdash;the
boy I have been a
mother to, and yet I haven't
been a true mother, for I
never have talked to you
of these things because they
were hard. You see I have
failed in my duty."</p>

<p>Instantly he was all tenderness.
He drew her
down into his boyish long
arms and laid his head
against hers. "You have
not failed in anything, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
darling!" he cried. "But
it wouldn't hurt me. I'm
a man. All the fellows do
that way."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"They tell about it. We
don't all talk about it in a
crowd, but just when we are
together, like John and me."</p>

<p>"Does John treat Rose
that way?"</p>

<p>The boy grew warm in a
minute. "He'd better not;
he went too far to suit me
to-night."</p>

<p>"Why did he?" she asked
quietly. "You were rather
free towards Dorothy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dorothy is different;
she's a&mdash;she's&mdash;well, she's a
jolly good fellow, but Rose&mdash;well,
I like Rose, and
every fellow better keep his
hands off her. I don't want
a girl all the fellows can
love; but I'm different.
Those things don't hurt
a fellow; he's coarser and&mdash;well,
it's expected of
him."</p>

<p>"But they do hurt you,"
she said. "The little book
of memories that Rose gave
you this afternoon told a
story of its own. I am going
to tell you this story."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked away into the
distance, and she began.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>"Once there was a man
who went into a garden.
All around him were beautiful
roses of all colours.
But he chose a little white
bud for his. He chose it
because it was pure and
white, but most of all because
it was closed. No
other person could see into
its heart. While he was
waiting for it to unfold he
walked around to enjoy the
other flowers. He studied
their colouring and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
breathed their perfume.
For a long time he enjoyed
this; then he wanted to get
nearer to these roses, to
handle them. Other travellers
were handling them
and they seemed to enjoy
themselves more than he
did. So he touched one
rather timidly; others he
was not so careful with. At
last he grew tired and wandered
back to his own rosebud
and lo! it had opened.
It stood the whitest and
most fragrant rose in the
garden, and its heart was
the dewiest and most tender.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
But he remembered
the crimson roses and it
seemed too white. Then
he could not detect its fragrance,
for he had killed his
sense of smell by its abuse
with the other roses, some
of which stood as high and
beautiful as before, but
others were left bruised
and broken by his ruthless
desire to please, yes, to
indulge himself. As he
plucked his own rose, he
was aware of no sense of
joy over it, except from
pride, for many travellers
cast him envious glances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
But he could not see its unusual
beauty; he could not
get the fragrance from its
heart, because his sense of
sight had been dulled by
the brilliancy of the other
flowers and his sense of
smell by their odour.</p>

<p>"Nor did he think of the
little buds in the garden
that he had touched and
then left. They would perhaps
open, but the petals he
had touched would always
be brown and torn. The
passers-by might not see
them when the flowers had
opened and revealed their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hearts, but the men who had
plucked them would&mdash;not
at once, but when they had
become less entranced and
were seeking for defects.
Then perhaps they would
throw the roses away. But
the man who had the perfect
rose&mdash;the one which
was perfect because it had
been well protected&mdash;did
not know of the havoc he
had wrought. He was too
much interested in wondering
why he did not enjoy
his rose, why it seemed so
commonplace and really
tiresome. He did not know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that it was he who had become
unable to appreciate
it, through his own indulgence
begun in an idle moment,
while he had waited
for his flower to blossom."</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>She paused to look into
his face. He was listening.
Then she went on:</p>

<p>"You say you are a man;
you have only thought of
one side; you have only
wanted the perfect rose.
You may get one, but if you
do it will be one which has
been carefully guarded.
You are not intending to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
break or bruise the other
roses; you are just going
to handle them because the
other boys do. You will
enjoy their fragrance, but
you will leave wounded
petals. Then after a time,
if you travel far enough into
the garden, you will grow
indifferent to the havoc you
are doing and will carelessly
crush the flowers. You
may grow so cruel that you
will enjoy it. There are
men who do, and they
started out as free from intention
to harm as you
were to-night. You caressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Dorothy; John caressed
her. The next boy
who comes along will find
it easier to be free with her,
and unless there is some
one who cares enough to
guard her she will be torn
from the stem before she
has blossomed. If you had
kissed Rose to-night it
would have been easy for
you to kiss her again. You
haven't yet, have you?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," she continued.
"It will be so much
better for her. If she permits
you these familiarities she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
will permit others the same
ones. She may soon become
as reckless as Dorothy,
and then we dare not think
of the future. You can see
now what a wonderful
flower she promises to make.
She is a perfect little bud.
Would you not hate to
think that you were spoiling
the promise of that
bud?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me for being so
cross," he begged.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," and she
kissed his lips. "But we
are going to look at your
side now. God made you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
so that you have certain desires,
certain cravings, that
you are to control. Many
men will say that they are
only to be satisfied, but we
know better. The first kiss
you give to a girl thrills
you&mdash;really it is one of the
greatest minutes of your
life. The next girl you kiss
seems less of a pleasure.
Then after a while it becomes
a mere habit; it loses all
sense of enjoyment&mdash;the
holiness has long since been
done away with. Stronger
desires than kissing arise
and soon you are not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
man God intended you to
be. You will have a low
idea of women. Even your
wife, if you get the sweetest
and purest in the world,
will not seem so to you.
Marriage will not be a sacred
fulfillment; it will be a commonplace
event."</p>

<p>His arms had tightened
around her, but he was
silent.</p>

<p>"And," she continued,
"your future career as a
man will be touched. You
cannot think clearly or act
quickly when any of the
senses of your body have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
been impaired. Lust kills
ambition, ability and power.
I do not mean that every
boy who starts in this way
has the same fatal ending,
but a great many do. There
is the half-way place where
many men stop; yet you
will find they are not real
men. It will be so much
holier and better to stay at
the beginning."</p>

<p>She sat silent, waiting for
him to speak. At last he
did. "Of course, Beth, I
wouldn't want to go even
half-way, now; I wouldn't
even want to touch"&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a tender smile played around
his lips&mdash;"any roses but
one. But I cannot see yet
why I can't let her know
that I care for her; I will be
constant. I want to like
her and I want her to like
me."</p>

<p>She drew a sharp breath.
"You mean you will crush
the petals of your own rose,
and then enjoy the heart
when it is opened. When
you come back you may
not even want to see that
heart; you are just a boy.
If you do, there will be
times when you will see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
those crushed petals and be
sorry. You may blame
yourself, but you will probably
blame Rose. You may
grow so discontented that
you will blame another man.
If you know she allowed
you these caresses, these
little familiarities, you will
think she would allow
others."</p>

<p>He spoke with pride. "I
know Rose."</p>

<p>"We will look at it from
her side. After she realizes
those petals have been
crushed by you she may be
afraid of the future. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
may be afraid that you have
wandered far into the garden
and come back to her
a worn-out traveller. She
may be afraid that you will
not appreciate her and that
you will not deal rightly
with her."</p>

<p>He laughed. "I am not
afraid of that."</p>

<p>"Other girls just as constant
in their friendship as
Rose have felt that way,"
she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"My dear boy, I have a
few wilted petals and I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
how they feel. You see,
I was like you are. There
was no one to guard me
and I did just what any
girl will do who does not
think. But I realized in
time to save myself from
only a few brown ones, and
I want to save every girl I
can. We were young and
thought we knew our hearts.
My, how they changed!
But they couldn't change
those bruised petals."</p>

<p>He gave a hurt cry, but
he saw a face free from suffering.
It held only love
for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Floyd, I want to give
the world a noble man.
That is the dearest wish of
every woman. I want to
give some woman a pure
husband; and oh, my darling
boy, I want to give you
life in its best and purest
forms. I put the first little
garment on your little body;
I changed you from a little
angel to a human being,
and I must care for that human
being."</p>

<p>"You angel!" he murmured.</p>

<p>She lifted his chin and
looked into his clear eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I promise," he said in
a low tone.</p>

<p>"It will not be easy, dear.
You will have to refuse to
listen to other boys, you
will have to read only good
books and you will have to
think pure thoughts. Rose's
little book will help you.
You can see the baby that
I am trying to keep pure
and help me do it; you can
see those doll shoes and remember
how you suffered
on the night you wanted
to be happy, because you
wanted to do as 'the fellows'
did. You were so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
anxious to know what was
in the heart of the rose
book. I do not know, but
she did tell me this. On
the second petal&mdash;and you
must look at it every day&mdash;is
the little picture of Sir
Galahad which your first
teacher gave you. Do you
remember it?"</p>

<p>The boy smiled dreamily
as he quoted&mdash;</p>
